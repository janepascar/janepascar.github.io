      <description>


&lt;p&gt;After almost a year of symptoms, many lab tests, MRIs, CT scans, colonoscopies, and two surgeries, in April 2018 I was officially diagnosed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304&#34;&gt;Crohn’s Disease&lt;/a&gt; and started a combined &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalimumab&#34;&gt;Humira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptopurine&#34;&gt;6-mercaptopurine&lt;/a&gt; regimen. In November 2019 I developed a high level of anti-Humira antibodies and my Humira drug levels were no longer detectable. Now, I receive &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rxlist.com/inflectra-side-effects-drug-center.htm&#34;&gt;Inflectra&lt;/a&gt; infusions every 8 weeks and continue to take 6MP daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./../2020-01-10.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;I am sitting in an infusion center with an IV. Stickers on the picture saying love your guts and #IBDvisible&#34; width=&#34;300&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of my diagnosis, I was living in Los Angeles working as a research tech at the University of Southern California after graduating from SUNY Oswego in 2017. I dedicated a year after undergrad to gaining more lab experience before eventually going back to school for my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was diagnosed, I had already been accepted to multiple programs and was leaning strongly towards Syracuse but had not officially committed — most grad programs in the U.S. require your commitment at the beginning of May. After my diagnosis, I had very little time to figure out all of the typical pre-graduate school logistics associated with moving across the country (again) but this time with the added caveat of a chronic illness. Luckily(?), my younger sister and brother have Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis, respectively, so my family was able to offer some advice. But there was still a lot I needed to figure out on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as a second-year student, I have had some time to acclimate to graduate school with a chronic illness. When I would research the topic I found many of the blog posts or forums helpful, yet fairly generalized so I want to put together some tips that are more geared towards grad students in STEM fields — but I’m sure some are still applicable to many graduate/undergraduate school experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;start-planning-early.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start planning early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know you will be moving for school and need to find new doctors, start as early as you possibly can to ensure a smooth transition. Even with referrals from your current doctors, it can be difficult to find offices accepting new patients and then to schedule appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute I knew I would be moving to Syracuse I immediately began looking for a new primary care physician and GI. Unfortunately, in Syracuse there is a shortage of doctors so the waitlists for both a PCP and GI were about 3-4 months long. I was able to schedule appointments in late May, so I had appointments shortly after I arrived in New York in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to talk to your doctors early on if you know there will be a period of time where you cannot yet see your new doctor, expect a lapse in insurance coverage, etc. about preparing for medical issues like stocking up on enough medicine beforehand to prepare. In my case, I was able to get pre-approved for a few extra Humira pens that I would be able to use during the time I was officially unemployed but had not started school yet at Syracuse. Don’t get me wrong — this was definitely a hassle, I was constantly playing phone tag with my insurance company, getting letters from my doctors, filing claims… but it had to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;really-learn-to-understand-your-insurance.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Really learn to understand your insurance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may sound harsh, but if you’re not advocating for yourself, who will? I’m sure you can imagine my shock the first time I received a bill for thousands of dollars. Unfortunately, this was not a one-off event. Sometimes my bills really are that high but countless times doctors’ offices, hospitals or pharmacies have made clerical errors that I have been responsible for catching — and these errors are never in my favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my diagnosis I didn’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have an understanding about the complexities of health insurance so it was absolutely necessary for me to gain an understanding as soon as possible. This is a good website to start learning insurance vocabulary: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/health-insurance-guide/overview/&#34;&gt;Understanding Health Insurance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is to ask questions first. If my doctor tells me that I need a lab test to monitor and maintain my health, I’m ultimately going to do it regardless of cost, but in the past I’ve assumed insurance just covers &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; and I’ve learned this is definitely not the case. It is easier to call your insurance company and ask about uncertainties rather than be surprised in 2 months when you receive an unexpected (and often very high) bill. Asking for permission or what your options are beforehand, in my experience, is easier than the uphill battle of trying to get coverage after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always call your insurance company if you have questions. Despite the often frustrating circumstances that led me to call, every time I have called the representative has been so helpful and kind over the phone. They have provided me with options I didn’t know were available. If you thought a procedure or test was going to be covered and it turns out not to be, you can file a claim where your doctor sends out additional information regarding the necessity of the test to maintain or monitor your health and the insurance company will have their doctors review the case and may actually reconsider! I’ve filed claims that have been both accepted and denied after review, but it was at least worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely look into assistance programs through either your doctor’s office, hospital, or the company that produces your drugs. When I was on Humira, a monthly supply of two pens cost $9,934.26, my insurance discount and coverage brought the cost down to $60 and after applying my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humira.com/humira-complete/cost-and-copay&#34;&gt;Humira Complete Savings Card&lt;/a&gt;, I only paid $5 a month. They also provide free sharps disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on Inflectra, a single infusion (including the hospital costs) is $15,395.76. Pfizer — the company that makes Inflectra — has an assistance program, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pfizerencompass.com/&#34;&gt;enCompass&lt;/a&gt;, that covers up to 100% of drug costs after insurance. After my first infusion of 2020, I was charged $2,600 (about 75% of my out-of-pocket maximum) but $1,950 of that was the cost of Inflectra so enCompass will cover this portion of my bill. I anticipate that after my next infusion I will hit my out-of-pocket maximum and after the assistance program reimburses me, I will have paid about $400. If all goes according to plan, I will have paid a little over $1,000 for my yearly medication rather than $3,400. 👍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;plan-out-your-budgetsavings-and-stick-to-it&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Plan out your budget/savings and stick to it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be unexpected costs that pop up but if you can try to plan ahead as much as possible hopefully it will alleviate some stress. These are good tips for all grad students whether you have a chronic illness or not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Syracuse I receive my stipend monthly during the academic year (9 months). This means that between June and August I have to live off of savings from the previous 9 months. Based on all of my monthly bills like rent, utilities, my car payment, car insurance, food, entertainment, etc. I liberally calculated how much I would need for those summer months and divided by 9 so I could continuously save throughout the year and avoid being strapped for cash midway through the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of a credit union it was free to set up additional savings accounts so I made one dedicated just to my summer savings so I wouldn’t be tempted to spend it during the academic year. I also set up an automatic transfer so after my stipend is deposited the amount I’ve dedicated to my summer savings is transferred to designated account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am on a fellowship, I do not get taxes taken out of my monthly paychecks and instead I have to pay quarterly estimated taxes which I have chosen to split evenly over all four fiscal quarters despite not being paid evenly throughout the year. Similar to my summer plan, I know the total amount I need to allocate each year, so I divided that number by 9. And again, I have a recurring transfer set up to help hold me accountable and keep me on track of my savings goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to have money in limbo and create a system to keep track of this money. Unfortunately, all of the universities I have attended or worked for reimburse you after the conference, workshop, field work, etc. is over even though registration, flights, and accommodations are often booked months in advance. At least in my field, many conferences occur during the summer, this only exacerbates the struggle of not receiving a paycheck during those months. To be honest, I haven’t figured out a perfect method to prepare for travel, since the cost fluctuates year-to-year, other than saving here and there. But I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know it is important to file the necessary paperwork as soon as possible and stay diligent until you are positive you are reimbursed in full. Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you have them because you literally may not be able to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m sure you know your chronic illness is accompanied by high medical bills, but if something pops up in your health and you need intervention this can result in unexpected bills. After I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understood my insurance policy I felt like I was in a better place to prepare for my expected and unexpected medical bills. Now that I am on Inflectra, I know I will hit my deductible and my $3,400 out-of-pocket maximum within my first two infusions of the new year. This is my first year following this approach but I anticipate this will be the hardest budget to save for since it is such a large amount, but the current plan is similar to my other savings plans. Starting this January (2020) I began putting aside about $200 each month to prepare for my first infusion of 2021. I am hoping this will be enough to cover my doctor’s small co-payments throughout the year with enough left over at the beginning on 2021 for when the insurance essentially resets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting after writing all out, makes me realize this is a lot and may seem extreme but for me it really helps the stress and anxiety that I have about already living on such a tight income during grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I should note that: I realize this type of budget is not possible for everyone in graduate school, especially those supporting others. I am only responsible for financially supporting myself at this time. Also, I live in an affordable city and have my student loans in deferment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;take-advantage-of-your-flexible-schedule.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Take advantage of your flexible schedule.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely parts of your week that are not as flexible like classes, teaching, meetings, seminars, etc. but one of the perks of academia is how much flexibility is possible. Most of my research is computational, and even though it is nice to sit at my desk where I have a nicer computer and a double monitor, I have the option to work away from the lab. Reading, grading papers, writing, and coding can be done from home if you are having a bad day where work is still possible, but you cannot make it to the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the flexibility of grad school is really useful when it comes to doctors’ appointments. It is important to prioritize your health which means keeping up with your doctors regularly. Between my PCP, GI, dermatologist (anti-TNF blockers carry a slightly increased risk of certain skin cancers), and an OBGYN there are a lot of appointments throughout the year I need to balance. I try to schedule my appointments for either the early morning or late afternoon so I can avoid leaving and coming back to the lab in the middle of the day. But if I do need to leave, I know it is not the end of the world and I will make that work up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;utilize-campus-resources.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Utilize campus resources.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your campus likely has resources like a gym, fitness classes, counseling, even some medical services available for free or at least at a subsidized cost. Definitely take advantage of these!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was a really emotionally difficult period when Humira stopped working; I was (and occasionally still am) anxious about my new medicine working and affording its increased cost compared to Humira so I eventually went and saw a counselor to talk about managing my anxiety and techniques to minimize this stress in my everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Syracuse the fitness centers are all free for students, even just 30 minutes on the elliptical has helped relieve some stress — especially during the long winters here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;it-is-up-to-you-who-you-tell-when-and-how-much.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. It is up to you who you tell, when, and how much.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosing your chronic illness is a highly personal decision, but it is important to know there are so many options and it is not all or nothing. In my personal experience, I have not contacted the Office of Disability Services on campus, but it is important that people with chronic illnesses are aware that it is an option to help navigate the specific accommodations possible on your campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have used the approach of disclosing when I feel it is necessary or I anticipate disruptions to my progress in the lab. The entire first year of my PhD, I didn’t tell anyone since I was in remission. Shortly after the beginning of my second year, I decided to tell my advisor because it felt like the right time. When starting the Inflectra infusions the loading doses occur at 0, 2, and 6 weeks so I was out of the lab for (what felt to me like) an uncharacteristically large amount of time, realistically it was only 3 days. Even though the culture in our lab is that as long as your get your work done, you’re good, it seemed like a good time to just give my advisor a heads up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;build-and-maintain-a-support-system.&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Build and maintain a support system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to build a support system for all of the ups and downs of grad school in general, but I have found it especially important for dealing with my chronic illness. Many of us are probably away from family and friends but staying in regular contact with the people that support us the most can be helpful in succeeding during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really appreciative for my friends and family that can empathize when I am feeling overwhelmed. Even when I say I don’t need help, my friends have insisted on driving me to appointments and even sitting through infusions with me for moral support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;im-less-than-two-years-into-both-living-with-crohns-and-my-phd-program-so-i-am-sure-there-is-a-lot-i-missed-or-overlooked.-if-you-have-other-tips-i-should-know-or-questions-please-contact-me&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;I’m less than two years into both living with Crohn’s and my PhD program, so I am sure there is a lot I missed or overlooked. If you have other tips I should know or questions, please contact me!&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>NSF GRFP personal statement example</title>
      <link>/post/2019-12-17_grfp-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2019-12-17_grfp-app/</guid>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of information, advice, and tips already available about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/&#34;&gt;National Science Foundation (NSF)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsfgrfp.org/&#34;&gt;Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)&lt;/a&gt; but I want to post my 2018 personal statement as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;pascar_2018_grfp_personal_statement.pdf&#34; class=&#34;section level5&#34;&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../2018_personal_GRFP.pdf&#34;&gt;Pascar_2018_GRFP_Personal_Statement.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that unlike some other fellowships and scholarships, the NSF GRFP places a great deal of emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;funding the scientist and not just the scientific proposal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began roughly outlining my personal statement about 2 months prior to the due date and worked simultaneously on the research proposal. I found this useful because if I hit writers block or a bump in the road collecting preliminary data it was nice to be able to switch to the personal statement to remain productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also nice to be able to send a semi-complete version of my personal statement to my letter writers so they could 1. see what I was emphasizing about my experiences with them and 2. see what I had been up to since I left their labs and where I envision my grad program going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to receiving feedback on my personal statement from my advisors, I attended workshops held by Syracuse University’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nationalscholarships.syr.edu/&#34;&gt;Center for Fellowship and Scholarship Advising Center&lt;/a&gt;. In these workshops, other undergrads and grad students applying had the opportunity to receive feedback from each other and professional staff. After these workshops I met two more times with the director of the CFSA to help review my statement for any last-minute edits. If your school doesn’t have an office dedicated solely to scholarship advising check out the writing center for advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found participating in workshops super helpful! In hindsight, my initial draft before receiving feedback was so boring. I basically turned my CV into paragraphs. Even though I find it difficult to write about myself, meeting with the CFSA helped me to articulate why I am so excited about science and helped me explain how I got where I am and where I see myself going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;remember-tell-a-story-about-yourself&#34; class=&#34;section level6&#34;&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Remember: tell a story about yourself!&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are resources complied by others I used while preparing my application (they also link to more resources):&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship&#34;&gt;Alex Wang’s Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ybrandvain/GRFP&#34;&gt;Yaniv Brandvain’s GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally…&lt;br /&gt;
- Twitter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23grfp&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34;&gt;#GRFP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nsfgrfp&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34;&gt;#NSFGRFP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Reddit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/&#34;&gt;r/GradSchool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/&#34;&gt;r/gradadmissions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/&#34;&gt;r/AskAcademia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;del&gt;GradCafe&lt;/del&gt;: Avoid the GradCafe forum. During my first GRFP application cycle before I started grad school, I would check it occasionally and it made me really stressed and anxious and there really isn’t even advice! There are a lot of people posting their accolades which inevitably caused imposter syndrome to set in. Furthermore, after the application due date passes, the forum mostly consists of speculating when the results will be posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Upon submittal, celebrate the victory of completing a fellowship application.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Do not read over your application again (you will likely find a spelling, grammatical, or formatting error… I did and it haunted me for months, but, realistically no one will probably even notice.)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Try to put it in the back of your mind until April and the announcement is actually made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
